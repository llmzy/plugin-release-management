Plugin designed to handle all tasks related to signing, releasing, and testing npm packages.

## Releases

The following steps are automated for package releases

### Version Bump

We use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to determine the next version that will be published. This means that all commits **must** adhere to the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in order for `standard-version` to work.

In the case that you have manually bumped the version in the package.json, then the plugin will respect that and publish that version instead of using `standard-version` to determine the next version.

NOTE: We consider the `chore`, `style`, `docs`, `ci`, `test` commit types to be "non-releasable", meaning that if all the commits are of those types then we do not publish a new version. However, if you've manually bumped the version in the package.json then the plugin will publish that version regardless of the commit types.

#### `--prerelease`

1. If you've manually bumped the version in the package.json, the prerelease tag will not be added if it's not already there. For example, if you want to do a prerelease for a new major version, you will want to update the package version to `X.0.0-<your-prerelease-tag>`.

2. When using the `--prerelease` flag, `standard-version` will bump both the prerelease version and the package version, e.g. `3.0.0-alpha.0` => `3.0.1-alpha.1`. See https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#release-as-a-pre-release for more

### Changelogs

`standard-version` automatically handles this for us as well. Again you must adhere to the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in order for the changelog generation to work.

### Build

After determining the next version, the plugin builds the package using `yarn build`. This means that you must have a `build` script included in the package.json

### Signing

If you pass the `--sign (-s)` flag into the release command, then the plugin will sign the package and verify that the signature exists in S3.

### Publishing

Once the package has been built and signed it will be published to npm. The command will not exit until the new version is found on the npm registry.

## Install

```bash
sfdx plugins:install release-management@x.y.z

4. [Build the plugin locally](#build)
5. Create a _topic_ branch in your fork. Note, this step is recommended but technically not required if contributing using a fork.
6. Edit the code in your fork.
7. Write appropriate tests for your changes. Try to achieve at least 95% code coverage on any new code. No pull request will be accepted without unit tests.

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-release-management

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/dev` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/dev npm
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sfdx cli
sfdx plugins:link .
# To verify
sfdx plugins
```
